For use in DevTools :
1) Go to "Cosnsole"
2) Past the code in the console and confirm
3) If there is no error, "<- undefined" will appear

IMPORTANT : With different window sizes the coordinates will be different, it is best to
            unstick the DevTools window so the canvas has fullscreen

Code:

<function getMousePosition(canvas, event) {
            let rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
            let x = event.clientX - rect.left;
            let y = event.clientY - rect.top;
            console.log("Coordinate x: " + x,
                        "Coordinate y: " + y);
        }

        let canvasElem = document.querySelector("canvas");

        canvasElem.addEventListener("mousedown", function(e)
        {
            getMousePosition(canvasElem, e);
        });>
